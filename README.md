# Static Node/Express SL JS Portfolio

FSJS Techdegree Project VI

## About

For project six of the FSJS Techdegree I built a basic portfolio website using Node.js as the server-side runtime environment, the Express framework to set up the routes, request/response handlers, middleware, and errors.

This project also utilizes JSON files wherein the data about my portfolio projects is stored, the Pug template engine to render HTML to the browser, and npm to package the third-party dependencies needed for the project.

## Exceeds Expectations Criteria

To obtain a grade of "exceeds expectations" I have done the following:

- established the package.json file to fire up the serving using the "npm start" command in the terminal
- Created two additional pug templates: one to render general errors to HTML and one to render the specific 404 error (error.pug and not-found.pug, respectively)
- Customized the styles.css file to add personal touch to the pages. I added a liner-gradient function to the profile-intro and profile-index classes giving the page a vibrant back-splash. In the "about" route, I manipulated the margins, font sizes and colors, and the list bullets. Lastly, in each of the routes the text colors have been slightly changed to better coordinate with the back-splash.
